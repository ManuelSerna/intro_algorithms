//***********************************************
* Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree (and greedy) algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
    - It finds a safe edge to add to the growing forest by finding, of all the edges that connect any two trees in the forest, an edge (u, v) of least weight.
        - When the algorithm ends, each vertex will be connected in a way that each edge will the optimally minimized.
    - It is greedy because at each step it adds to the forest an edge of least possible weight.


//-----------------------------------------------
 Kruskal's algorithm pseudo code.
//-----------------------------------------------
#DEFINE G = (V, E)  // graph with sets of vertices (V) and edges (E)
#DEFINE w           // weight function between two vertices u and v

MST_KRUSKAL(G, w)
    // initialize min span tree A to be empty, will add min edges
    A = empty set
    
    // create |V| trees, one containing each vertex, this is how you will merge "sub trees" to create the min span tree (returned as A)
    for each vertex v that exists in G.V
        MAKE_SET(v)
    
    // Next step is to sort:
    sort the edges of G.E into nondecreasing order by weight w
    
    // Examine edges in order of weight (lowest->highest)
    for each edge (u, v) that exists in G.E, taken in nondecreasing order by weight
        // Check if vertices u and v belong to the same tree, if they do, then edge (u, v) cannot be added to the forest without creating a cycle
        if FIND_SET(u) != FIND_SET(v)
            A = A U {(u, v)}    // add edge to A
            UNION(u, v)         // merge the vertices in the two trees
    return A


Further notes
------------------------

Running time:
    - depends on disjoint data structure is implemented, for this pseudo code assume disjoint-set-forest implementation with the union-by-rank and path-compression heuristics.
    
    - Doing some math, running time of Kruskal's algorithm can be stated as O(E lgV).
