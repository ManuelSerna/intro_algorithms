//***********************************************
 Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) notes.
//***********************************************

Suppose you have a graph G = (V, E), and G contains sets V (contains all the vertices in G) and E (possible edges that connect any two vertices in V), for each edge (u, v) (u and v vertices) there is an associated weight, denoted w(u, v) specifying the cost to traverse the edge.

* Minimum spanning tree problem: given E, we want to find an acyclic subset T of E where all vertices are connected and the total weight is minimized.

In here a "generic" method for growing a minimum spanning tree is introduced, the Kruskal and Prim algorithms implement this generic method.
    - They are both greedy algorithms


The generic method below manages a set of edges, call it, and it must maintain the loop invariant (meaning this condition must hold until the loop is done).
    
    Prior to each iteration, A is a subset of some minimum spanning tree.

At each step, try to add some edge (u, v) that does not violate the invariant, consequently, A U {(u, v)} should also be a subset of a minimum spanning tree.
    * Safe edge: can safely add an edge (u, v) and not violate the invariant.

//-----------------------------------------------
 Generic procedure for building a mst.
//-----------------------------------------------
GENERIC_MST(G, w)
    A = empty set of edges
    while A does not form a spanning tree
        find an edge (u, v) that is safe for A
        A = A U {(u, v)}
    return A // at this point, A is a mst since all edges were added to A
    
* Cut: a cut (S, V - S) of an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a partition of V.
    - (S) and (V-S) are distinct sets of vertices, and may have edges between them (accounted for below).

* Cross: an edge (u, v) that exists in E crosses the cut (S, V-S) if one of its endpoints is in S and the other in V-S.

* Respect: a cut respects a set of A edges if no edge in A crosses the cut.

* Light edge: an edge is a light edge crossing a cut if its weight is the minimum of any edge crossing the cut.
    - There can be more than one light edge in the case of ties.
    
* Safe edge:
    Let G = (V, E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, let (S, V - S) be any cut of G that respects A, and let (u, v) be a light edge crossing (S, V - S) Then, edge (u, v) is safe for A.
