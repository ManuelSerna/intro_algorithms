 Greedy algorithms notes.
//***********************************************

For many optimization problems, suing dynamic programming to determine the best choices is overkill; simpler, more efficient algorithms will do.
*A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution.

Greedy algorithms don't always give the best value, but it does for many problems.
