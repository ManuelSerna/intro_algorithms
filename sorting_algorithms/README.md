# Sorting Algorithms

## Content

### Sorting
This section contains general information about all the sorting algorithms that will be presented.

### Heapsort
This section contains an overview of the heap data structure and how heapsort utilizes several heap procedures. Priority queues are also discussed as they build on the procedures used by regular heaps.

### Quicksort
This section contains an analysis of the quicksort's procedures as well as an analysis of best and worst-case running times.

### Linear Time Sorting
This section goes over three non-comparison sorting algorithms--counting sort, radix sort, and bucket sort. Each of their procedures and running times are analyzed, along with example cases.

### Pseudocode
This document contains pseudocode to all the sorting algorithms mentioned in the book: insertion sort, merge sort, all the max-heap and min-heap operations along with heapsort, quicksort, counting sort, radix sort, and bucket sort along with analysis of their procedures. All of the sorting algorithms are implemented with Python.
