### Divide and Conquer
This section looks at the nature of divide and conquer algorithms and looks at merge sort as an example with analysis with its associated recurrence and closed-form recurrence using the iterative method. The master method for solving recurrences in the form ```T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)``` is also discussed.
