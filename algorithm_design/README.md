### Divide and Conquer
This section looks at the nature of divide and conquer algorithms and looks at merge sort as an example with analysis with its associated recurrence and closed-form recurrence using the iterative method. The master method for solving recurrences in the form ```T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)``` is also discussed.

### Dynamic Programming
These are the implementations for dynamic programming problems:

* Rod Cutting

* Matrix-chain multiplication
	
	I will also include my work on Abdul Bari's example on matrix chain multiplication.

### Greedy Algorithms
I have the activity selection problem implemented in Python.
