### Divide and Conquer
This section looks at the nature of divide and conquer algorithms and looks at merge sort as an example with analysis with its associated recurrence and closed-form recurrence using the iterative method. The master method for solving recurrences in the form ```T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)``` is also discussed.

### Dynamic Programming
This section contains my notes on dynamic programming, along with included topics.

* Rod Cutting

* Matrix-chain multiplication
	I will also include my work on Abdul Bari's example on matrix chain multiplication.

### Greedy Algorithms
This section contains my notes on greedy algorithms. I went over the activity selection problem along with some notes on Huffman codes.
