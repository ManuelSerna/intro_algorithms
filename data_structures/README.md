# Data Structures

## Content

### Elementary Data Structures
This section contains implementations of the stack and queue procedures. These will serve as subroutines for other algorithms later on.

### Hashing
This section contains an old assignment where three open-addressing methods are empirically tested. This is the extent to which I delved into hashing, I may come back to explore the topic more formally

### Binary Search Trees
TBD

### Red-Black Trees
These are gnarly. TBD
