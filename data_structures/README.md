# Data Structures

## Content

### Elementary Data Structures
This section contains implementations of the stack and queue procedures. These will serve as subroutines for other algorithms later on.

### Hashing
This section contains an old assignment where three open-addressing methods are empirically tested. This is the extent to which I delved into hashing, I may come back to explore the topic more formally

### Binary Search Trees
This section covers the basics of binary search procedures and their run times. I also put all the chapter's pseudocode into one file. This also contains an implementation in C++.

### Red-Black Trees
This section contains an overview on the standard procedures for red-black trees. Be familiar with binary search trees before tackling this as the topics get much more complex. I have implemented the book's pseudocode in C++. I also have a couple of problems from the book that deal with insertion and deletion worked out.
