# intro_algorithms

This is a collection of my notes and code for various algorithms, data structures, and the like. If anyone finds this, feel free to look at what I have and perhaps also add improvements. Also, I would recommend others read the book with these notes so as to make sense of what the authors were trying to convey.

## Before reading my notes
  * Whenever I use ```log(n)```, I mean the common logarithm (log base 10). I will write the natural log as ```ln(n)```. The logarithm with base 2 will be written normally, although the book writes it as ```lg(n)```.
