# intro_algorithms

This is a collection of my notes and code for various algorithms, data structures, and the like. If anyone finds this, feel free to look at what I have and perhaps also add improvements. Also, I would recommend others read the book with these notes so as to make sense of what the authors were trying to convey.

## Content
### Analysis
* Getting Started: starting notes for CLRS
* Asymptotic Notation: an introduction to asymptotic notation
* Further Notes: miscellaneous notes on growth rates and log rules

### Algorithm Design
* Divide and Conquer: personal notes and some examples
* Dynamic Programming: some examples provided
* Greedy Algorithms: some examples provided

### Sorting Algorithms
Note: all the sections here have notes and implementations.

* Sorting: general notes on sorting algorithms
* Insertion sort: implementation (discussed in Getting Started)
* Merge sort: implementation (discussed in Divide and Conquer)
* Heapsort: heap data structures and heapsort algorithm
* Quicksort
* Linear Time Sorting: includes...
  * Counting sort
  * Radix sort
  * Bucket sort

### Data Structures
* Elementary Data Structures: implementations of stack and queue
* Hashing: implementation of open-addressing methods (old homework)
* Binary Search Trees: notes and implementation
* Red-Black Trees: notes and implementation

### Select Topics
Interesting stuff from CLRS not discussed from my course.
