# into_algorithms

This repository contains pseudocode and/or implementations of various algorithms, data structures, etc. for my Algorithms course at the University of Arkansas.

### Sorting algorithms and data structures covered:
* Part 1:
    * Insertion sort
    * Merge sort
    * Maximum subarray problem
    * Matrix multiplication
    * Heap peocedures (pseudo code only)
    * Quicksort
    * Counting sort
    * Radix sort (pseudo code only)
    * Bucket sort (pseudo code only)
    * Binary search tree (pseudo code only)

* Part 2:
    * Red-Black trees
    * and more to come...
