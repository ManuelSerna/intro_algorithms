# intro_algorithms

This repository contains pseudo code and/or implementations of various algorithms, data structures, etc. for my Algorithms course at the University of Arkansas.

## Textbook used
Cormen, T. H., Leiserson, C. E., Rivest, R. L., & Stein, C. (n.d.). Introduction to algorithms (3rd ed.).

I used the above source to take notes, write pseudo code, and implement many of the algorithms and data structures.

## Sorting algorithms and data structures covered:
* __Insertion sort__: pseudo code, and Python implementation.

* __Merge sort__: pseudo code, and C++ implementation.

* __Maximum subarray problem__: C++ implementation.

* __Matrix multiplication__: naive implementation; Strassen's notes and pseudo code.

* __Heaps__: pseudo code with some notes over heap procedures.

* __Quicksort__: pseudo code and C++ implementation.

* __Linear time sorting__:
  * __Counting sort__: pseudo code and C++ implementation.
  
  * __Radix sort__: pseudo code.
  
  * __Bucket sort__: pseudo code.

* __Elementary Data Structures__:
  * __Stack__: pseudo code and C++ implementation.
  
  * __Queue__: some notes and pseudo code.
  
  * __Linked Lists__: pseudo code.

* __Binary search trees__:
  * __Regular binary search tree__: some notes, pseudo code, and NEED TO IMPLEMENT.
  
  * __Red-black trees__: some notes, pseudo code, and C++ implementation (NOT COMPLETE--NEED DELETE OPERATION).
  
  * __Order-Statistics trees (dynamic order statistics)__: pseudo code.

* __Dynamic Programming__: general notes solely on topic.
  
  * __Rod cutting__: some notes, pseudo code, and Python implementation.
  
  * __Matrix-chain multiply__: some notes, pseudo code, and NEED TO IMPLEMENT.

* __Greedy Algorithms__: in progress.

* __Elementary graph algorithms__: in progress.
