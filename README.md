# intro_algorithms

This is a collection of my notes and code for various algorithms, data structures, and the like. Feel free to look at what I have and perhaps also add improvements. I would recommend others read the book with these notes so as to make sense of what the authors were trying to convey.

## Content
### Analysis
* __Getting Started__: starting notes for CLRS
* __Asymptotic Notation__: an introduction to asymptotic notation
* __Further Notes__: miscellaneous notes on growth rates and log rules

### Algorithm Design
* __Divide and Conquer__: personal notes and some examples
* __Dynamic Programming__: some examples provided
* __Greedy Algorithms__: some examples provided

### Sorting Algorithms
Note: all the sections here have notes and implementations.

* __Sorting__: general notes on sorting algorithms
* __Insertion sort__: implementation (discussed in Getting Started)
* __Merge sort__: implementation (discussed in Divide and Conquer)
* __Heapsort__: heap data structures and heapsort algorithm
* __Quicksort__
* __Linear Time Sorting__: includes...
  * Counting sort
  * Radix sort
  * Bucket sort

### Data Structures
* __Elementary Data Structures__: implementations of stack and queue
* __Hashing__: implementation of open-addressing methods (old homework)
* __Binary Search Trees__: notes and implementation
* __Red-Black Trees__: notes and implementation

### Graph Algorithms
* __Elementary Graph Algorithms__
* __Minimum Spanning Trees__
* __Single-Source Shortest Paths__
* __All-Pairs Shortest Paths__

### Select Topics
Interesting stuff from CLRS not discussed from my course.
