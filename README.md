# intro_algorithms

After my finals, I will completely overhaul the content here. My wish is to have properly formatted notes written in something like LATEX for each topic I covered, in addition, I would also like to implement everything useful that I covered in my course, ideally in a single programming language, but I may do several for the same algorithm or data structure. 

I hope to be done with this ambitious project by the end of August 2019, I will steadily work on this, update other repos, and work an internship over the summer. I want to help others as much as I can, although I am not the best at this topic, I still desire to help others succeed, hopefully my work will help somebody, and that will make me happy. For any that are reading this, patience!
