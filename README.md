# intro_algorithms

This repository contains pseudo code and/or implementations of various algorithms, data structures, etc. for my Algorithms course at the University of Arkansas.

## Textbook used
Cormen, T. H., Leiserson, C. E., Rivest, R. L., & Stein, C. (n.d.). Introduction to algorithms (3rd ed.).

I used the above source to take notes, write pseudo code, and implement many of the algorithms and data structures.

## Sorting algorithms and data structures covered:
* Insertion sort:
  - Pseudo code, and Python implementation.

* Merge sort:
  - Pseudo code, and C++ implementation.

* Maximum subarray problem:
  - C++ implementation.

* Matrix multiplication:
  - Naive implementation.
  - Strassen's notes and pseudo code.

* Heapsort (with procedures):
  - Pseudo code with some notes.

* Quicksort:
  - Pseudo code and C++ implementation.

* Linear time sorting:
  * Counting sort:
    - Pseudo code and C++ implementation.
  
  * Radix sort:
    - Pseudo code.
  
  * Bucket sort:
    - Pseudo code.

* Elementary Data Structures:
  * Stack:
    - Pseudo code and C++ implementation.
  
  * Queue:
    - Some notes and pseudo code.
  
  * Linked Lists:
    - Pseudo code.

* Binary search trees:
  * Regular binary search tree:
    - Some notes, pseudo code, and NEED TO IMPLEMENT.
  
  * Red-black trees:
    - Some notes, pseudo code, and C++ implementation (NOT COMPLETE--NEED DELETE OPERATION).
  
  * Order-Statistics trees (dynamic order statistics):
    - Pseudo code.

* Dynamic Programming
  - General notes solely on topic.
  
  * Rod cutting:
    - Some notes, pseudo code, and Python implementation (NOT COMPLETE--SOME ERRORS).
  
  * Matrix-chain multiply:
    - Some notes, pseudo code, and NEED TO IMPLEMENT.

* Greedy Algorithms:
  - in progress.

* Elementary graph algorithms:
  - in progress.
