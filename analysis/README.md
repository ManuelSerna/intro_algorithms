### Getting Started
This section focuses on introducing the reader to the analysis of algorithms and begins doing so with insertion sort. The book analyses each line in its pseudocode and comes up with the best and worst-case running times. Merge sort is then analyzed but in a more mathematical approach, more independent of any code, the book provides useful figures to help visualize this. 

### Asymptotic Notation
This section builds on asymptotic notation introduced in _Getting Started_, it talks about theta, big-O, big-omega, little-o, and little-omega notations. I also wrote down some properties.
