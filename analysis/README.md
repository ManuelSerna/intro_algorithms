# Getting Started

## Content

### Getting Started
This section focuses on introducing the reader to the analysis of algorithms and begins doing so with insertion sort. The book analyzes each line in its pseudocode and comes up with the best and worst-case running times. This serves as the basis in analyzing pseudo code and will help us come up with running times.

### Asymptotic Notation
This section builds on asymptotic notation introduced in _Getting Started_, it talks about theta, big-O, big-omega, little-o, and little-omega notations. I also wrote down some properties.

### Further Notes
This is a miscellaneous document with notes on comparing growth rates between different general forms of functions with examples. Logarithm rules are also included.
